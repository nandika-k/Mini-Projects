# 1. The script should allow two players to play, player 1 is the user and player 2 is the
#  computer.
#  2. The script should greet the players when it starts
#  3. It should explain the rules of Rock Paper Scissors:
#  3a. Rock beats scissors (by crushing them).
#  3b. Scissors beat paper (by cutting it).
#  3c. paper beats rock (by covering it).
#  4. The script should allow the player to enter in their selection (use read command). You
#  can assume the user will only type in rock, paper, or scissors (all lower-case).
#  5. It should print out the computerâ€™s selection, which should be random (hint: you can
#  use the RANDOM environment variable along with '%' to limit the range, similar to
#  Exercise three in class).
#  6. Should declare a winner, or a tie.
#  7. If there's a tie, the script should rematch until there's a winner
